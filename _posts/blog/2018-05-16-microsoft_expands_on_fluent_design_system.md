With Microsoft's Build 2018 conference wrapping up last week, developers were given an overview of updates to the Windows toolkit referred to as Fluent Design. After looking over the updated documentation, I feel this is a great resource for designers and developers alike.

Fluent Design not only gives a glympse of where Windows 10 is going visually, but the guidelines offer examples to follow for good design principles. Examples of topics covered include layout, inputs, and usability.

These principles are not only helpful in creating a Windows application, but factors to generally keep in mind as a designer.
