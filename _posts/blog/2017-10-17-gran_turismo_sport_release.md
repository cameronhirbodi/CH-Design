After the inevitable delays, the day has finally come for another release in the Gran Turismo series. Even with rivals heating things up in the sim racing category these days, I have always appreciated the extra polish and detail that goes into Polyphony Digital's products. Gran Turismo Sport is no exception and the results are beautiful with accuracy in both the high resolution models as well as the tracks they drive on.

I would like to see improvements in the sound department and the loss of dynamic weather is a bit of a bummer. Having said that, the positives far outweigh these. Today's release is just the start and I am sure the game will only get better with DLC.

Gran Turismo Sport can be purchased today from retailers.
