There is no question Airbnb puts a lot of importance to design. There is a ton of inspiration and resources aspiring designers can take from them. One example is a new solution they created known as Lottie.

This is an open-source tool that makes it easier for developers to embed animation in web and mobile applications. Rather than recreating existing animations in code, Lottie simplifies the process by allowing developers to import existing animations created in After Effects.
