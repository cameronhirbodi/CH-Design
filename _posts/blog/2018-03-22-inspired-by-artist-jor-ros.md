There are some artists that can get me to whip out the ol' pen and pad again. While there is a ton of great work out there, one illustrator that I recently came upon stood out to me. Though I don't get into the Anime and Manga scene as much these days, I always loved the Japanese culture and the influence it has on artists. 

Jor Ros uses more realism than is seen in most Anime yet it feels stylized in his own way. I enjoy his choices of color, the urban streetwear influence, and how he incorporates geometric figures. 

I encourage anyone reading this to support him in purchasing even a small print from his store as I just have.
