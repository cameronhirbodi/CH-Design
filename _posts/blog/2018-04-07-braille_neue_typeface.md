Outside of the visually impaired, using Braille does not seem to be common for many in today's society. Designer Kosuke Takahashi from Tokyo has attempted to resolve this issue and increase exposure.

The goal was to create a typeface that combines both standard letterforms with that of Braille in both English and Japanese. By doing this both the sighted and visually impaired can reference and understand a single typeface. For those that do not have trouble seeing, the Braille Neue typeface still serves as a reminder for the importance of inclusion and understanding how Braille works.
