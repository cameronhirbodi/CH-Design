###### Role

UI Designer / Developer

###### Objective

In order to showcase work effectively, a digital presence was crucial. The goal was to have it be easy to share and allow anyone to access it regardless of device type or platform.

The previous website was not mobile responsive and used a WordPress environment. While it was easy to add content with a CMS system, this added bloat and the site slowdowns were noticeable.

After some research, Jekyll came up as a viable solution. This was a way to create blog-like posts without the need for a database. This meant the ability to hand-code the site with HTML & CSS / SASS but still utilize features like posts, categories, and permalinks. 

Using Git to version control and keep track of commits and branches over the years helps to stay organized.

After the tech and development side was sorted out, it was time to move forward with the designs using a combination of Photoshop, Illustrator, and XD. This helped visualize everything prior to jumping straight into the code.

Today, new work and general polish to the site comes regulary. The site is hosted for free using GitHub Pages. All source code is publicly available at the link below.
