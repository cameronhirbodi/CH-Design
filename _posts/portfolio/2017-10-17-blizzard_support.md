This objective of this website is that it allows players to easily identify and solve their issues with any Blizzard product. Players can receive support on account, technical, and gameplay related issues.

With the development of the Blizzard Support portal, it was important to adhere to corporate style guidelines and to make the layout scale well on all device types. The design research is ongoing where there is more opportunity to improve the overall experience and usability.
