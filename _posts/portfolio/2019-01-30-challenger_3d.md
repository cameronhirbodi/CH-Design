This has been an exercise for me in learning to create 3D renderings with Blender. Using a reference image of the vehicle from all angles ensures that the model is true to the original spec.

I plan to complete the remaining components of the vehicle, adding texture, and incorporating lighting effects to give it a more complete, polished look.
