I am currently in the process of modeling a Dodge Challenger vehicle in 3D.

![Dodge Challenger - 3D Solid Rendering]({{ "/images/portfolio/challenger_3d/solid.jpg" }})

This has been an exercise for me in learning to create renderings with Blender 3D. Using a reference image of the vehicle from all angles ensures that the model is true to the original spec. 

I plan to complete the remaining components of the vehicle, adding texture, and incorporating lighting effects.
