##### My Role

Visual Design, User Testing, Icon Design, Animation, Prototyping, Development

##### Objective

This web portal was designed to assist Blizzard game customers in solving their issues to quickly return them to their game. A ground-up overhaul was required to bring the site to modern design standards.

The Blizzard Support site offers useful resources such as knowledge-base articles and self service solutions with regards to account, technical, and gameplay related issues. These methods are designed to allow customers to self serve themselves. Should these solutions not help, escalating the issue to a customer service representative should be simple and straight forward.

###### Style Tiles

The previous rendition of the Blizzard Support portal did not adhere closely to the company's brand guidelines. To address this, the first exercise was to create style tiles to illustrate various design directions we could apply to the whole website.

![Blizzard Support - Style Tile Version 3]({{ "/images/portfolio/blizz_supp/blizz_supp_05.jpg" }})

###### Component Libraries

The next step was to start building component libraries and style guides for other designers and developers to use as patterns. This ensures consistency across the site which is critical.

###### Prototyping and Animation

Next, these UI components were applied to low fidelity flows created in collaboration with UX designers to transition them into high fidelity mockups. 

Micro interactions and animations were then created between screens to build out a working prototype. This helps illustrate the design flow to various stakeholders.

###### Design Specs

In order to reach the level of fidelity the design team was seeking on the final product, detailed design specs were provided to the engineering team.

###### Reporting

Looking at the transformation to the newly redesigned website, several key goals were reached. Reports show an increased success rate for customer self-services and has resulted in less company contacts. This resulted in drastic company cost savings.

###### Prototype

Being able to showcase screen to screen flows and to convey desired microinteractions and animations is helpful for developers to understand implentation.

###### Next Steps

There are more ongoing initiatives for the website today. This includes embedding the support model within in-game experiences, designing recommendation systems with machine learning algorithms, and updating component libraries on the design to code environment to assist developers. There is also a growing effort into making the site compliant with regards to accessibility and catering to those that require assistive devices.
