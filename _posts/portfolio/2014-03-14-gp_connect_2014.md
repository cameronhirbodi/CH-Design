Bringing the app to life was a great exercise for myself to understand the basic responsibilites of a software developer. This allowed me to leave my comfort zone as strictly a designer in order to learn basic programming.

The early development stages required basic wireframes to vet with various users for input. After obtaining their feedback, I iterated on these for higher fidelity mockups and created branding and identity for the project. To have an understanding of the development side required traveling to conferences hosted by BlackBerry, connecting with other developers for tips, reading through design / developer guidelines, and learning a new markup language called QML.

Though the BlackBerry 10 operating system was ultimately decommisioned, it taught me the same principles I will use today to develop on any modern platform. In the end, after months of learning basic developer principles, I finally accomplished the task of basic app creation.
