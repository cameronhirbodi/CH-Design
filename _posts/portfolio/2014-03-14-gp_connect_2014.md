The creation of this app was an exercise for myself to understand the role as a software developer. This allowed me to leave my comfort zone as strictly being a designer and to learn basic programming. The requirements were basic and allowed Formula 1 fans to learn about their favorite drivers and tracks and to see results as the season went on.

The conception stages required basic wireframes to vet with various users for input. After taking in their feedback, I iterated on these into higher fidelity mockups and created branding and identity for the project. Getting an understanding of the development side required going to conferences hosted by BlackBerry, connecting with other developers for tips, reading through design / developer guidelines, and learning a new markup language called QML.

Though the BlackBerry 10 operating system this app was for was ultimately decommisioned, it taught me the same principles I will use today to develop on any modern platform. In the end, after months of learning basic developer principles, I finally accomplished the task of getting my very own app out there.
