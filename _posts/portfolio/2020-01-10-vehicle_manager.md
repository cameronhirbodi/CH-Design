##### My Role

Research, Visual Design, Prototyping

##### The Challenge

Throughout the duration of vehicle ownership, sifting through large paper vehicle manuals can be cumbersome. Despite valuable knowledge being provided, instructions, vague diagrams, and illustrations can be difficult to follow.

Additionally, physical manuals for warranty information and service record books requiring manual write ups from owners are common. These manuals require physical storage in the vehicle or household.

##### The Solution

The companion app allows owners to tap into real time features and access all knowledge of their vehicle without a traditional paper owner's manual. Critical needs and service reminders are presented clearly to the user.

##### My Approach

As part of research and execution of this project, the following processes were required:

###### Competitive Analysis

Researching similarly functioning apps from various automotive OEMs was a critical step. It helped to know what functions were offered and which were emphasized most.

To start, research was done on apps from three manufacturers: Honda, Porsche, and Ford.

Looking through customer reviews for these apps from both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store helped to surface common customer frustrations. Knowing these issues would help to put more thought into how to address these from a usability standpoint. On the other hand, there were positives to take from the reviews too.
