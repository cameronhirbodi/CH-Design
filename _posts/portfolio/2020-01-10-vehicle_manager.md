##### My Role

Research, Visual Design, Prototyping

##### The Challenge

Throughout the duration of vehicle ownership, sifting through large paper vehicle manuals can be cumbersome. Despite valuable knowledge being provided, instructions, vague diagrams, and illustrations can be difficult to follow.

Warranty information and service record books requiring manual write ups from owners are common and require physical storage in areas such as the vehicle or household.

##### The Solution

The companion app allows owners to tap into real time features and access all knowledge of their vehicle without a traditional paper owner's manual. Critical needs and service reminders should be clearly presented to the user.

##### My Approach

As part of research and execution of this project, the following processes were required:

###### Competitive Analysis

Researching existing apps helped to understand the approach that various OEMs have taken. Knowing what functions were offered and how they were emphasized was important.

The three manufacturers chosen for this were Honda, Porsche, and Ford.

Reading through customer reviews from both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store helped to surface common customer frustrations. Knowing what worked and didn't work for users would influence how I would design my product. I distingushed these with green and red highlights.

Patterns of positive feedback from a small sample of reviews included the ability to show parking location, fuel consumption figures, vehicle gauge figures in real time, service reminders, and the ability to start / lock the car remotely. Of the three chosen OEMs, Ford's app had the most positive ratings.

There were numerous desired or negative feedback as well. These included showing historic fuel economy figures, radio presets, remote window and roof controls, and exposing general vehicle figures more clearly.
