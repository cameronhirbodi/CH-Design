###### Role

Illustrator

###### Objective

This illustration was an exercise in creating a fantasy digital illustration using a stylus with Photoshop layering. Since childhood, illustration has been a passion of mine and is still something I intend to regularly do when the opportunity arrives.

This was done with a digital stylus, various brushes, and heavy layering in Photoshop to reach the final result.
