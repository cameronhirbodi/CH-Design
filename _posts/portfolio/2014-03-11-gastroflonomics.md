This blog was created as a way for the client to quickly share her experiences related to food and culture from around the world.

My involvement in this culinary blog was strictly on the front-end development. This was a collaboration with another designer that provided the interface and visual assets. The blog is built on a self-hosted, custom Wordpress which required some PHP and CSS altering. This was the ideal solution for the blogger to quickly manage her own content.
