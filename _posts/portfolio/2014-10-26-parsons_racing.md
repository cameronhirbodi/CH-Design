##### My Role

Visual Design, Brand Design

##### Objective

This logo and liveries were created to represent the Parson's Racing identity. Cameron Parson has a longtime racing career in Formula cars, karting, and sim racing.

![Parson's Racing - Camaro]({{ "/images/portfolio/parsons/parsons_01.jpg" }})

Several iterations were required from early conception. As a result, we landed on a logo that displayed Cameron's love for racing in a simple yet dynamic portrayal.

The logo is currently used on various vehicles, apparel, and other material.

![Parson's Racing - Apparel]({{ "/images/portfolio/parsons/parsons_04.jpg" }})

Another challenge I was tasked with was to create a livery design for Cameron's Camaro being raced in the Trans-Am Series. One of these designs was also adapted to a Corvette he was driving in a simulator race.
