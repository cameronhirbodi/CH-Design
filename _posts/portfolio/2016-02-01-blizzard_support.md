This web portal was designed to assist Blizzard game customers in solving their issues to quickly get them back into the game.

Players are offered assistance and resources with account, technical, and gameplay related issues. Contact channels exist for reaching customer service representatives along with workflows that offer self service solutions.

With the development of the Blizzard Support Portal, it was important to adhere to corporate style guidelines and to make the layout scale well on all device types. The design research is ongoing where there is more opportunity to improve the overall experience and usability over time.
