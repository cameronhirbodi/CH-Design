###### Role

3D Artist

###### Objective

This goal of this piece was learning to create 3D renderings with Blender. Using a reference image of the vehicle from all angles ensures that the model is true to the original spec.

This is a work in progress. There is still outstanding work remaining including the components of the vehicle, adding texture, and incorporating lighting effects to give it a more complete, polished look.
