This exercise is intended to test various user interactions with instrument clusters using an interactive prototype model.

The first step was to conceptualize the layout for how the user will simulate basic in-car controls. Once a rough sketch was settled on, the next task was to convert this to a digital outline using Adobe Illustrator.

From there, I began creating the full color, high-fidelity mockups. Lastly, numerous screens were made to account for each animation and state of the process in Adobe XD.

The next steps will be developing the prototype to be less of a linear demo and more functional for a user. This would also help to run users through the interactions and gather feedback from the sessions.
