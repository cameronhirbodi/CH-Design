This is a simple exercise to familiarize myself with in-car instrument gauge clusters. Applying UI design principles to this type of experience is a new challenge for me.

The next steps will be to iterate on this interface by adding more polish and missing details. Finally, the cluster should incorporate subtle but meaningful animations to improve usability.
