This is a simple exercise to familiarize myself with general in-car instrument gauge cluster interfaces by creating an interactive prototype with animation.

Applying UI principles to the design experience for driving a car is a new challenge for me.

The next steps will be to iterate on this interface by adding more polish and missing interactions.
