This exercise is intended to test various user interactions with an instrument cluster using an interactive prototype model.

The first step was to conceptualize the layout for how the user will simulate basic in-car controls. Once I settled on a rouch sketch, converting this to digital outlines was necessary. From there, I began creating the full color, high-fidelity mockups. Lastly, numerous screens were made to account for each animation and state of the process.

The next steps will be to run through these flows with user testing and incorporating new feedback I feel is necessary for an improved experience.
