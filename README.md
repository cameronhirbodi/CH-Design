## CH Design

As a full time UI Designer, I enjoy collaborating with others and using visual strategies to create an enjoyable experience for users. Expanding my knowledge in visual design and programming drives me. Other passions of mine include motorsports, music, and technology. 

## Welcome

This website was created to showcase my portfolio work. It was mostly developed from scratch using HTML and CSS/SASS with the exception of incorporating [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a static site generator.
